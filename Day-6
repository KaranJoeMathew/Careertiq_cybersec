[ absolute path - relative path ]
rockyou.txt from github



CREATE AND CRACK HASH:

--- mkdir johnhash && cd johnhash
--- cd ~/Desktop/johnhash

--- echo password12 | md5sum
--- echo -n password12 | md5sum
[ both above gives different hash ]
[ use the one with -n, find why ]

--- echo -n pasword12 | md5sum > hash3
--- cat hash3
--- john hash3 -w=rockyou.txt

error. why?
see the hash3 file again. find "-" extra. delete it, redo.
--- cat hash3
--- nano hash3 = edit the hash content
(or)
--- mousepad hash3 = edit the hash content
--- john hash3 -w=rockyou.txt

error. solution in the error message:
--- john hash3 -w=rockyou.txt --format=RAW-MD5

--- rm hash3
--- rmdir Harea
format = john filename wordlist / john target bullet



INSTALL NEW APPLICATIONS:
--- sudo apt install mousepad
--- sudo apt install ssh
if already there = it gets updated

--- mv ~/Downloads?rockyou.txt .
. means current directory

drag and drop file from Real to Fake

install rockyou, put in ur directory
do dictionary attack

from [~]
cd desktop
ls
cat password.txt

pdf2john
zip2john
... ...



HASHING, CRACKING WITH HASHCAT:

--- hashcat --help
--- hashcat --help | grep md5
--- hashcat --help | grep sha256

find attack mode from above command
--- hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hash3 rockyou.txt

edit hash file, remove "-" from end
--- mousepad hashtext3 = edit the hashfile
--- cat hashtext3 = check
--- hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hash3 rockyou.txt

ctrl +o
ctrl+ x

--- cd ~
--- whoami
--- pwd
--- ls
--- cd Desktop
--- mkdir johnhash
--- ls
--- cd johnhash
( as i have dragged and dropped the rockyou.txt file in desktop )
better to do with no directory

cd Desktop
pwd
ls
cat test.pdf
pdf2john test.pdf /home/user/Desktop
pdf2john test.pdf > hash7.txt
cat hash7.txt
nano hash7.txt
cat hash7.txt
hashcat test.pdf rockyou.txt
hashcat --help
hashcat -m 10700 hash7.txt /home/user/Desktop/rockypu.txt -O
john hash7.txt -w=rockyou.txt


--- locate command = 
update the kali db
