SIEM=

Security information and event management:

event = observable occurence

different logs

need for logs:

analyze ssh logs for authorized remote connection.
time, location, ip-address to check.

create rules to capture and create logs.

capture what?

log if someone scans for open ports.

port 80, 443

ports = gateways/ entry points

port scanning = an observable occurence = event

use case.

firewall logs.

active windows firewall?

need for firewall

firewall rules:
inbound rules
outbound rules

inturrupts the network layer.
windows defender firewall with advanced security

use firewall to make a system to allow only one ip-address.
filter un-wanted traffic.
create the rules.

a remote system for a team.
in that remote system, in its firewall, configure it to allow only the five ip-address of the team

ur system, trying illegal website = firewall blocks it.
create a simple rule.
outbound rules.

anti-virus = identifies malware = behaviour based, signature based.
malicious software = malware

signature based

splunk download.
download md5 to verify your bits = signature based for verification = compare hashes
hashcalc or hashcalculator.
== check for integrity.

virus total platform = check with 40 + companies = better than one anti-virus.

macro virus.
write script in word document or excel document

try installing utorrent. if system blocks it, your antivirus is working.

virustotal uses the hash value to find whether it is malware or not.
check signature.
calculate hash, match with its data base.

only anti virus = untrustable
layered defence is necessary.

hashcalc
virustotal

downloading cracked version of games, spotify mod, netflix mod
modified files.
use virus total and check it.

SIEM = all in one tool = correlate all these activities. give us the result if it is malicious or not.

Splunk is one of those.

companies keep updating the signature

windows logs = @ event viewer.


go to event viewer, go to security logs. save selected events in desktop.
upload in splunk.

source="Windows logs.evtx"
search filter in splunk

do filters. data wise, last 24 hours...
