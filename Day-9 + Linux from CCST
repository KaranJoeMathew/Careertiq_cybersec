Even if this os got hacked, windows os outside is safe.

change from NAT to Bridged adapter

---------------------------
add user accounts to HR group

add Ramya as new user, move her to HR group
--- adduser Ramya

move Ramya to HR group
--- usermod -G HR Ramya

do same for another new user
--- adduser Gayathri
--- usermod -G HR Gayathri

verify new users in passwd file
--- cat /etc/passwd

view users in shadow file
--- cat /etc/shadow
---------------------------
login as Ramya, explore directories and change permissions:
switch user from root to Ramya
GUI, menu, logout, switch user, login as Ramya, open terminal.

explore environment
--- pwd
