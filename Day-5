fakeVM:
start wireshark capture
open https website in firefox
stop wireshark capture.

filter the traffic
- - ip.addr == @ip-address of the website?

encryption and hashing difference:
hashing = 1 way = irreversible
encryption = 2 way
hashing = fixed length hash
integrity check = check for alteration
share hash value to the receiver to check for changes
can save in database too. but encryption = no.

registry is for control, not for storage

:c\windows\system32\config\sam
can't read sam file when system is on.
need to read hard disk, retrive sam.

Linux = shadow file
/etc/shadow

salting = adding random values in between hash values to make it uncrackable

/etc/passwd
/bin/zsh
/var/log
[ /bin, /var, /etc ]

--- cat /etc/passwd | grep /bin/zsh
--- cd /var/log = log of server stored here
--- cd apache2

to search in a folder
--- grep -r folder
--- sudo grep -r "19.168.145.144"

check acces logs of the yesterday server
concentrate on one ip address
--- cat ssh.log
--- grep -r parrot (or) user

dig a log to find an incident
incident = something that affects CIA
do full analysis, find root cause
system completly compromised = intrusion
event = alerts = observable occurence
intrusion   incident    event = know the difference

virtualbox > workstation

in windows = event manager or event viewer
SIEM tools to manage Event Viewer to see logs in windows

DLP tool:
to make sure analyser prevents unauthorized copy.
no copy, no share, no alter. all in logs are analysed.

[ FP, TP, FN, TN ]
-- attack alert format
FP = no attack but alert
TP = attack, alert
TN = attack, no alert. TN is dangerous
FN = no attack, alert
SIEM not properly configured.

brute force = explore all options until answer found.
permutations and combinations.
4 digit pin. find possibilities. 1000.
10 digit, lowercase = 141 T possible. 12 days to crack.

need for CPU + GPU
GPU = faster mathematical calculations
GPU = 10x of CPU.
GPU based machine = Crackers/ miners = a service.
5 char = 11 minutes with GPU.
crack with kali = CPU alone. overheat, fail too.
change motherboard.
brute force complications:
digits, symbols, upper, lower case = buteforce takes a lifetime.
passphrase = infinity war.

dictionary attack >> brute force attack (efficiency)
various password lists available. famous = "rockyou.txt". 137mb file in github
1.6 crore most comenly used passwords there.


birthday attack
collect info from social media, create own word list
[ CRUNCH ] tool available in github. create own wordlist

find a hash, crack it with rockyou.txt
MD5 hashing algorithm.

text to md file. a tool.
[ | = to combine ]
--- echo saish | md5sum > sfile.txt
--- ls
--- cat sfile.txt

hashcat = gpu based tool
hydra = online based tool
jhontheripper = cpu based tool
