Proxy an VPN:
Internet is untrustable, anyone can listen.
VPN = just encrypts our connection. a tunnel.
Proxy = intermeditate between client and server.
Tor uses proxy or vpn? = proxy.
there are 6 proxy between client and server. 3 are openly open, 3 are ananyomous.
No logs policy.

Tails OS is safe. Tor adds only anoyimity and not safety. (only for educational purpose)

initiate a communication with a server, clint sends SYN packet first.
client, SYN = Hi. Server, SYN, ACK.

3 way handshake. only with TCP.
SYN = hi
SYN, ACK = received, hi
ACK = got it

FIN at the end.

UDP = no retransmission.
QUIC = new L4 protocol. uses sockets

HTTP methods and response codes:
201 = created
404 = not found
4 = client side error
5 = server side error
2,4,5
code start with 1 = informational message
3 = redirection or switching protocols. http to https, login page to dashboard.

first page = index.html

Encryption prevents copying. So saves Integrity??

Tamper proof data

difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption and their realtime usage.
EY

Symmetric encryption in bank statements: first 4 lowercase, last 4 digits??
Single password to sign in = symmetric = unsafe
Symmetric = 1 key
Asymmetric - 2 keys
3 way handshake does it. TLS handshake does it.
no lock symbol = http = no TLS handshake. No Asymmetric encryption.
WIRESHARK!!!!!!!
Public key exchange between client and server
PKI = public key infrastructure
Keys are there!! = in browser.
to check the public, private key. open terminal, 

in terminal
pwd
ls
ls -a
see hidden files
--- ssh-keygen

pwd
ls
ls -la
ls -al
ls -a
cd .ssh
cat id_rsa

ll
ssh = port 22
cloud nowadays. secure remote connection.
ssh = shell = no GUI and only CLI


windows = ssh = access linux machine.
windows = ssh client = pre installed

systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
systemctl status ssh

tcpdump = cli version of wireshark

start your own server:
use linux to start a server.

pre installed apache?
sudo systemctl start apache2

connect fake and real with ssh connection.
run fake as a server and acces it from real.
sudo su = change to super user


go and paste ip address of fake
