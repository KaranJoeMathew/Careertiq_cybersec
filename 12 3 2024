web server running.
wireshark always on behind.
run along the splunk forwarder.
give a wireshark log of hacked server.
analyze the wireshark log.
find how they hacked it.
do the same way to hack again.
attacker changed password.
do the same, find password.
retrieve the system.
go inside, take control of the system.

ftp, telnet, http = unencrypted.
so find information here. filter the traffic

based on protocol, attack time etc to reduce.
ftp... can read data.
"ftp" in search bar to filter.
attaker ip address
destination is the victim.
OSI layer details
FTP code 220. so req response success.
request says user jenny
dictionary attack

/var/www/html = web server's root directory
STOR = upload a shell.

cracked ftp, logged in, uploading a reverse shell.
chmod 777 shell.php
quit
how a reverse shell works?
someone has to execute that particular file.
we uploaded in the webserver itself.

ssh doesnt open a file
start apache server, have remote access

html file created with touch
uploaded a file inside /var/www/html = call it in url itself
shell.php

attacker quit ftp after uploaded
attacker checked pwd at /var/www/html
uploaded shell
left it

devs = connect to server, upload file

after ftp, we have http packets.

calling the shell.php
attacker will get the reverse shell.
he executed it.

logs till now is in wireshark
logs saved in /var/logs file from now.

THM's kali >> Own in VM
internet > extra resources.
55 minutes free.


from attackbox,
ping the target device
ftp the target device

1 interview,
gave hack the box machine.
get root access in 30 minutes
or else go out.
for pentesting...
7.5 lakhs.

for SOC analyst. god knows what.

use john, hashcat etc to crack password here??
we dont have the hash file.
we are communicating online.
online cracking tool.

one login name -l
multiple login names -L FILE
exlore the options
admin, root, guest, administrator... usernames common.
from seclists.

submit a wordlist.
rockyou.

supported services
ldap, mysql, http, cisco, rdp, rlogin, smp, ssh!, teamspeak
attack passwords

100 people communicate in same traffic like cod.
teamspeak creates a small server for olden days.
good server = handle traffic.
hack online vm, vnc to write other's exam?
in same network? sit somewhere and write exam,
anydisk?
vnc = hidden from radars.

Hydra. need wordlist.
attackbox wont work for internet. works for associated target machine.
