web server running.
wireshark always on behind.
run along the splunk forwarder.
give a wireshark log of hacked server.
analyze the wireshark log.
find how they hacked it.
do the same way to hack again.
attacker changed password.
do the same, find password.
retrieve the system.
go inside, take control of the system.

ftp, telnet, http = unencrypted.
so find information here. filter the traffic

based on protocol, attack time etc to reduce.
ftp... can read data.
"ftp" in search bar to filter.
attaker ip address
destination is the victim.
OSI layer details
FTP code 220. so req response success.
request says user jenny
dictionary attack

/var/www/html = web server's root directory
STOR = upload a shell.

cracked ftp, logged in, uploading a reverse shell.
chmod 777 shell.php
quit
how a reverse shell works?
someone has to execute that particular file.
we uploaded in the webserver itself.

ssh doesnt open a file
start apache server, have remote access

html file created with touch
uploaded a file inside /var/www/html = call it in url itself
shell.php

attacker quit ftp after uploaded
attacker checked pwd at /var/www/html
uploaded shell
left it

devs = connect to server, upload file

after ftp, we have http packets.

calling the shell.php
attacker will get the reverse shell.
he executed it.

logs till now is in wireshark
logs saved in /var/logs file from now.

THM's kali >> Own in VM
internet > extra resources.
55 minutes free.


from attackbox,
ping the target device
ftp the target device

1 interview,
gave hack the box machine.
get root access in 30 minutes
or else go out.
for pentesting...
7.5 lakhs.

for SOC analyst. god knows what.

use john, hashcat etc to crack password here??
we dont have the hash file.
we are communicating online.
online cracking tool.
H Y D R A
- hydra
so we crack password without the hash value?
one login name -l
multiple login names -L FILE
exlore the options
admin, root, guest, administrator... usernames common.
from seclists.

submit a wordlist.
rockyou.

supported services
ldap, mysql, http, cisco, rdp, rlogin, smp, ssh!, teamspeak
attack passwords

100 people communicate in same traffic like cod.
teamspeak creates a small server for olden days.
good server = handle traffic.
hack online vm, vnc to write other's exam?
in same network? sit somewhere and write exam,
anydisk?
vnc = hidden from radars.

Hydra. need wordlist.
attackbox wont work for internet. works for associated target machine.
a wordlist exists in the machine.
/usr/local/share?
- locate rockyou
LOCATE COMMAND

- hydra -l jenny -P /usr/../rockyou.txt 10.10.1.. ftp
different ways or formats to use hydra

tryhackme is an isolated network
hack traffic lights
connect to?
mangatha la?
traffic lights also in isolated network.

me in home. cant access cit network.
insider or proxy or vpn.

process to connect to different networks.
use vpn to?
given in tryhackme website!
need access to tryhackme network
open vpn free than attackbox

copy paste not working
use python server

download the vpn file from the website
for connection to that isolated server

in regular 1 (india)

install the ovpn file from tryhackme
drag and drop into the parrot machine
cd desktop
find ovpn file
- sudo openvpn 1Nila.ovpn

open new terminal and ping for test connectivity.
no.
open new terminal. ip a.
see one more interface. tun 0.

do hydra
- hydra -l jenny -P /home/kali/Downloads/rockyou.txt 10.10.90.116 ftp -t 64
multi threading means to do it faster.
default, hydra uses 16 threads. 16 passwords per second.
got password.

login to ftp as we got password.
now upload the reverse shell and get access to the system
- locate reverse
revshells.com

change ip adddress in reverse shell
- nano rev.php
pentest monkey code copy

tryhackme - access menubar - in regular 1 - 

getting the reverse shell
port number 8899

ftp, target ip address
username password that we cracked
- ls
shell.php index.html?
upload this
- get
- put
in ftp to send and receive files from ftp
- put shell.php
trigger this.
browser -> 
command to listener, then trigger the file.

---------------------------------------------------------

gain root access.
revershell?
upload a script.
upload reverse shell.
target ip address connects to our ip address.
reverse shell should have our ip address. kali ip.
its like a malware.

u send a malware, they use it. we get access.

this gaining access, revershell, listener. shit is pain.

upload reverse shell, gain access.
till that do.

thm h4cker room.

================================================================
reverse shell.
give your number
they call you, gets hacked.
same
press 1, 2, 3 like that we use port numbers.
first 1024 ports dont use

task manager in linux
- ps
use kill command to stop
create, kill tunnel

give your ip in reverse shell.
upload file.
find permissions. you got rw, not x
so use chmod

upload the file

upload shell
change permission
start listener port 
execute

get the apache page
get the reverse shell

-------------
- curl ip /
use internet without a browser in command prompt
- curl http://10.12.87.143/rev.php
easy.

got reverse shell.
check which user do we have.
root, admin, guest

hack the machine = we get basic user access.
to install an application, need admin.
in lunix we become root. admin in windowss.

check which user are we using.
- whoami
/www/data ?
why not username jenny?

file executed by jenny but still... why?
we used jenny's ftp.
- ps
search for apache.
apace server is run by www/data

run apache server as root = gone.
permission management.
new user for a website as /www/data
give limited accesss.
hacker should not navigate to user or root directory.
misconfiguration. chmod. blindly follow.

www/data to jenny how?
password reuse vulnerability
try switching to jenny with same password.
- su - jenny
we have reverse shell = weak shell.
cant use su command.
upgrade the shell?
proper shell to execute terminal command.

need better reverse shell.
available in kali is outdated. stable shell is needed.
find in github, revshell.com
---------------

python >>
needed for stable reverse shell

- python
check it is there or not
(call python, check) like ping.
- which python
- which python3

python module - import - get a stable shell.
same thing for windows:
= where tool-name

- python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash/")
c = command
pty module
spawns a shell
use /bin/zsh or /bin/sh or /user/zsh
platform name check. 
read the command.
is it a directory?

reach the right article.
searching for it.

refer articles. but understand how it does it.


- stty raw echo  ;  fg

OSCP certification like this...
notes or biheart
for ceh not needed
- stty raw -echo; fg

after becoming jenny user,
switch again as root user
does jenny have sudo to root?



check in etc groups to see it.
or use command,
- id
- sudo -l """""""""""""""""
lists all commands we can run as sudo
looks like we can run as all r
run file or appln as sudo

without jenny's password not possible.
she used ftp password as system password
need to use lots of other passwords.

switch user again.
- sudo su
- su -root
sudo su is better

reptile?
read flag.txt
- find / -iname flag.txt
if error comes. already running as root. so no errors comes.
- find / -iname flag.txt 2>/dev/null
find
/ = entire system = root directory in website. system dir in system.
flush the error


now we got the flag.
read it.
echo head tail more less
---------------------------------------
thm, free machines are plenty
do them.
with walkthrough too.

aux
all user execute
- ps aux | grep openvpn   (there but still)
- htop (there)
like task manager

oops see machine name
in hackthe box

openvpn from hackthebox website as well

windows server 2019
installation.
active directory etc... things

gobuster
wfuzz
for proper directory

rce = remote code exe
reverse shell

---------------
htb academy- active dir for beginners
