Internet = anyone can listen, untrustable.
VPN = encrypt message. tunnel.
Proxy = intermediate between client, server.
Tor uses proxy
6 proxy between client, server. 3 open, 3 anonymous.
No log policy.

Tails, Qubes... = safe OS.
Tor adds anonymity, not safety.
scientific, research, educational purpose alone. visit darkweb, experience gore, warcrimes...

SYN = hi
SYN, ACK = roger, hi
ACK = roger
client starts it. The " Threeway Handshake ". exclusively TCP.

TCP Three way handshake
TLS handshake

there is also FIN etc.. packets.

UDP = no retransmission.
QUIC = new L4 protocol. uses sockets

HTTP methods and response codes:
  1.. = informational message
  2.. = success
  3.. = redirection
  4.. = client error
  5.. = server error

first page = index.html

elements of security: CIA++

Tamper proof data

difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption and their realtime usage.

Symmetric encryption in bank statements: default ones are?
Symmetric = 1 key
Asymmetric - 2 keys. TLS handshake does it.
no lock symbol = http = no TLS handshake. No Asymmetric encryption.

Public key exchange between client and server
PKI = public key infrastructure
Keys are there!! = in browser.

to check public, private key:
  pwd
  ls
  ls -a = see hidden files
  --- ssh-keygen
  cd .ssh
  cat id_rsa

[ ls,  ls -la,  ls -al,  ls -a ]
ll

cloud widely used nowadays. secure remote connection.
ssh widely used = shell = no GUI and only CLI.

windows = ssh = access linux machine.
windows = ssh client = pre installed.

connect realPC and fakeVM with ssh connection
fakeVM = server. realPC = client.

--- sudo su = super user
--- systemctl start ssh
--- systemctl start apache2 = start own server

ifconfig = note the fakeVM ip address
paste it in realPC browser

cd /var/www/html
ls
rm index.html
ls
pwd
rm index.nginx-debian.html
echo "it is what it is" > myfile2
pwd
ls
systemctl stop apache2
systemctl stop ssh

systemctl == [ start stop status enable disable ]

tcpdump = cli version of wireshark
-----------------------------------------------------

extras:
for using proxy chains. from ceh chuck course:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install tor -y
sudo service tor start
sudo service tor stop
sudo service tor status
sudo nano /etc/proychains.conf
edit it for your configuration
