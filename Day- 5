hashing = fixed length hash
hash = 1 way
encryption = 2 way
integrity check = check for alteration

hash calc = share hash value to the receiver to check for changes
hashing is irreversible
can save in database too. but encryption = no.

registry is for control, not for storage

c
windows
system32
config
sam

cant read the sam file. cant while on. will need to read the hard disk. retrieve the sam.

Linux = shadow file

 cat ssh.log
grep -r parrot

dig a log to find an incident
incident = something that affects CIA
do full analysis
find root cause

change the password

virtualbox > workstation
system completly compromised = intrusion
event = alerts = observable occurence
intrusion   incident    event = know the difference

affect CIA = incident.
/var/log = logs in linux
in windows = event manager or event viewer
SIEM tools to manage Event Viewer to see logs in windows

DLP tool to make sure the analyser  = prevents unauthorized copy.
cant copy, cant mail the logs
no copy, no delete, no alter. all in logs. will be analyzed.
wrong alert = FP.
alert came, no attack.
TP = attack happened, alert happened.
TP FP TN FN = confusing.
FP vs TP =
TN = attack happened, no alert came,
SIEM not properly configured.
FN = mostly dont happen.
