Learn in a holistic manner as a computer science engineer.

veracrypt = disk encryption tool
partition a disk, encrypt that too = share it/ portable
can't grow or shrink
use 2 different passwords to show different data when forced
encryption algorithm
veracrypt2john = crack the password of the encrypted disk
passphrase = good
create, mount disk in veracrypt

bctextencoder = simple.
encrypt text, share it.
symmetric = share password as well.

compliance terms = regulations,  standards,  policies,  procedures.

--------------------------------


iso/iec 27k, nist, pci dss = standards
regulations = gdpr, hipaa, ccpa
compliance: implement specific sec ctrl, risk assessments, data breach notifications
enter permesis by 8. take a note of it. calculate the deviation in the year end.

audits. internal, external audits. audit is a compliance.
all works as per company's vision and mission.


GDPR is a regulation
regulations = laws given by government
not in india but europe
individual companies = policies enforced by procedure which are steps to follow
standards = PCI, NIST, ISO
comply with the rules
Industry creates standards to follow by companies


data classification:
based on sensitivity

risk = a potential to cause damage.
iso 27001, iso27002 = 2 diff standards

prioritize based on impact, likelyhood

passive and active

link between regulation/ standard with an incident

IT act = indian regulation
cheat an user for 1 rupee or 1000 crore, 1 year punishment for all

gdpr = none can escape
pci dss = payent card industry

rashmika deep fake videos = guy got caught. will roam out in 3 months.

internet presence itself a risk now.

linked by government. need policies. regulatios sucks.

protect people.
save server room or people?
human ethics
data > people for company
people are replacable.

disaster recovery plan.
incident response teams.
diff teamns, diff thinking

risk management:

risk treatment process:
  avoid a risk: 100% gone
  reduce the risk: wear helmet, no use of own vehicles for college students, 
  transfer a risk: isurance. transfer own risk to company. use ola instead own.
  acceptance: we know it will fail but its ok. strategically wrong but operationally okay.

risk monitoring:
 firewall, anti virus
SIEM tools
SPLUNK = master of SIEM = free

more than 15LPA = 25% tax
