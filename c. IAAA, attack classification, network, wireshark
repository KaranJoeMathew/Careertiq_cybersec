Elements of InfoSec:
  CIA triad ++
  Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Authenticity, Non-repudiation
    non-repudiation = sender can't deny they sent it. receiver can't deny they received it.

authentication = check the identity to access the system = login detail
authorization =  check the authorities to access the resources = privilege level

Authentication types:
  what you know
  what you have
  what you are

Authorization: all have different types of access/ permission

Attack classification:
  active = cause damage,
  passive = monitor,
  close-in = within range,
  insider = imposter,
  distribution attacks = hard to categorize good, bad

motive, method, vulnerabilities

DDos available in GitHub

Network concept:
  ip address
  ports purpose = 1 device = 1 ip address = many services simultaniously = each port for each service
  ports = no delay and congestion = " logical entry points " = distribute 1 IPadrs to all ports, get service.

people send packet without ip address in dark web

segmentation = security = virtual segrigation:
1 LAN with multiple hosts use 1 public IP address for all hosts.

CIDR notation

subnet calculator in google
Angry IP scanner

run wireshark 24/7 in background for security.
2 logical system = realPC, fakeVM
run wireshark in fakeVM
note the realPC ip, ping it in fakeVM
see details in wireshark running in fakeVM.
look at unencrypted data, metadata.
