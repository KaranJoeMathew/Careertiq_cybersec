Attack classification:
  active: cause damage
  passive: just monitor
  close in attack: within range
  insider attack: imposter/spy
  distribution attack: hard to stop. can't categorize legitimate and non ones.

motive, method, vulnerabilities

DDos available in GitHub

Network concept:
ip address
ports- the need for ports = 1 device use many service. causes congestion in multitasking generation. so have various, each port does 1 service.
people send packet without ip address in dark web
segmentation for security reasons. virtual segregation. home routuer: one public and more private adrs ok.
but in a college, 60 people, 1 router has 1 public ip adrs. to which pvt adrs send the data???

CIDR notation

subnet calculator in google
Angry IP scanner

without ports= congestion, delay
logical entry points
1 ip adrs distributed to all ports to get services


2 logical systems: realPC + VM
open wireshark in VM and run it.
Go to realPC - cmd - ipconfig. note the realPC ip-address.
Go to VM - cmd - ping realPC-ip-address.
see the details in wireshark running in the VM.
Can look into data and read un-encrypted packets like when HTTP, telnet is used.

run wireshark in the background 24/7 by entities for security.
