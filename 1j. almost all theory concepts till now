28/2/24:

SIEM?
Security events and information management
collects logs, correlates, log analysis, present findings to end user

IDS, IPS?
works on Layer 3

what is intrusion?
what is incident?
what is breach?

intrusion = alert = there mmay be... potential
breach = system compromized. 100% access maybe
incident = compromizes CIA

ids, ips = 
siem = no preventive action.
the tool itself doesnt prevent attack.
for that we need SOAR.

SOAR = security orchestration, automation and response

threat intelligence 
intelligence = acquire, apply knowledge and skills
"make decisions"

GPT?
generative pretrained transformed
kaggle = take datasets from it

gather all the incident that happens in the world.
all threats in one place
=== threat intelligence == a database with collection of threats
arranged on priority basis
threat intelligence platform
involves ML too

automated action with SOAR.
SIEM vs SOAR difference.

allinone platform from fw to siem to soar.
firewall = packet filtering. thats all. predefined set of rules.
anti-virus = based on signature with its virus database.
virus total is a good one.

know the difference between these tools.
-------------------------------------------------
WAF=
web application firewall
"cloudflare"
stops 90% of the attacks
how to configure cloudflare ??

CMS =content management system
wordpress
wordfence

cloudflare = mask real ip-address with proxy or reverse proxy.
proxy = in between C and S
WAF inbetween = u ping server but you ping the middle WAF only.

concentrates only on web application attacks.
wont stop ssh
waf wont stop hydra
webserver attacks wont be stopped
webapplication attacks will be stopped

web application  vs  web server

free ids, ips, snort
free waf = cloudflare
siem also free
own SOC centre for free of cost

company spends crores to make work easier.

VPN =
vpn encrypts data, creates a tunnel.
do proxy, then vpn
or just tor.

zero trust network access  ==  zero trust policy
authentication = always multifactor
authorization = limited access for particular job

LAN ports are blocked, monitored.
it team needs to configure with ur mac address.

workstation completly monitored. no trust.
find mac address, give permissions.

iot config with physical address.

DEFENCE IN DEPTH:
different controls, etc...

Data loss prevention:
siem, ids, ips, fw = diff role than this
copy a sensitive data.
insider threats
satisfy workers = only solution for insiders
DLP = all data monitored
free DLP there
monitor google drive, ports, directories, email...
data loss = not deleting and recover but privacy and data integrity.

Cisco Packet Tracer

EndPoint Security:
complete security for that particular host.
anti-virus
firewall
ids, ips
siem for a host
even iot can be monitored with siem
printer, tv, washing machine, fridge

ids = host based, network based
thousands of pc means no hids but nids in between
NIDS vs HIDS usescases

EDR = endpoint detection and response
XDR = extended detection and response

EDR = can't replace SIEM
makes sure host is properly connected to network
has the permission to connect to this network
no intrusion or incident
versions, firewall off?, misconfigured?
these things...
Uniqueness of EDR = affected by malware? it removes it from network. stops it from spreading to other hosts
which other tools don't

endpoint compliance:
regular system updates
patch management
these also detected by XDR
endpoint management

remote monitoring tools

downlaod an app?
report sent to admin -> management -> allow

download torrent in office laptop.
terminate you in 20 minutes.
ISMS policy.
ISMS = information security management system
join an org = sign a 15 page policy...
read it. detailed report for you.
violate ISMS = actions. no warnings.
code of context = some warnings.

Whitelist, Blacklist
whitelist = allow
whitelisted ip = trusted or known ip address
unknown ip address, contineously flooding request = blacklist that ip-address
that domain...

whitebox testing 

SDLC, different methodoligies, waterfall method...

know everything before doing =  white box testing
about software development perspective.
Quality assurance...
entire blue print of application to test

blackbox testing = all we know is target ip or domain or range of ip
no knowledge of internal structure.

greybox = partial knowledge.
they tell us the presence of proxy etc...
database. little info.

cloud models: SaaS, PaaS, IaaS.
which is better for our use.

deployment model:
public, private, hybrid.
based on infrastructure.

own car = private
hire ola = public

Hackathon in SRM?

give me a sepate cloud instance.
a separate computer used only by me = private cloud.
only I use the entire resource. entire instance.

cloud = always third party.
not data center.

every instance = a virtual machine. a cloud.
public cloud = 1 machine has 4 VM for different organizations.

thirdly = not a word.

one hardware or infra is one. but diff vm, diff instances in same hardware.
if one instance is hacked. there is a possibility for others in that pc to get hacked.

hybrid = some in public, some in private.

got hacked meaning?

private instance
public instance
based on infrastructure.

one shared drive...

which deployment model to choose: lots of questions, research, brainstromming sessions...
which one is cost effective..

one drive = 5gb free for all.
delete in local system, gone there too.

cant have google drive on local system.

hybrid = ?

before joining a college or company.
first send anonymous message, chat to learn more to them. like 20 to 30 people, about internal politics etc...
have 2 to 3 offers.

ask the students who studied. real intelligence.
dont go with the marketting.

cloud platforms: aws, oracle, ibm, google, azure, gcp, render

Cloud security:
authentication and access control
cloud authentication + IAM = identity and access management

all have separate identity
something you know, you have, you are

admin = identity = roles given according to it
normal user = roles, scopes, limited access.
based on the identity

policies
windows policy, group policy.
change passwords every 28 days.
a policy.

role based authentication.
role based access control.

role based = based on role
mandatory access control = deals with sensitive. the opposite of DAC. PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE.
discrenetiary access control = u have all rights for it. sole authority to do actions.

what is discretion?

Defend integrity
without internet = no access

WAF implemented before the cloud.
User -- waf/proxy -- cloud.

if know our cloud = send 1000 requests
cloud works on pay as per usage.
someone continious request = waste of money for user.
so need to monitor carefully.

monitor with SIEM...
